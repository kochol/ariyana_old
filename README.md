Ariyana is a WIP game engine that is planned to include these features.

## Planned features

- Cross-platform
  - Windows
  - Linux
  - Android
- Fast
  - I try to make the engine easy to use but the performance is the high priority, There are many easy to use engine out there already.
  - Using fibers to jobify the engine
  - Using frame buffers that is introduced in GDC talk by Christian Gyrling in his 2015 GDC Talk 'Parallelizing the Naughty Dog Engine Using Fibers'
- Entity component system
